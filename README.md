Template repository to create new agents with custom spines for [Upkie](https://github.com/upkie/upkie) wheeled bipeds.

If you don't need a custom spine, you can implement your agent in Python directly. Check out the [MPC](https://github.com/upkie/mpc_balancer) or [Pink](https://github.com/upkie/pink_balancer) balancers for instance.

## Getting started

1. Create a new repository from this template
2. Search for the string "TODO" and update files accordingly
3. Replace `LICENSE` with the license of your choice (the default one is Apache-2.0)
4. Start listing your dependencies in `environment.yaml`
5. Rename and start implement your agent from `agent.py`
6. Implement your C++ spines in the `spines` directory

## Usage

- Install Python packages to a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
- Activate conda environment: `conda activate <env_name>`
- Run the simulation spine: `make run_bullet_spine`
- Build the pi3hat spine locally: `make build`
- Upload the full repository (with built spines) to the robot: `make upload`
- Run the pi3hat spine: `make run_pi3hat_spine` (on robot)
- Run your agent: `python agent.py`
